## This is a Sample Project showing the implementation of Polygon ID

### Project - Age Verification Through Polygon ID via QR Code, In order to get the Airdrop of ERC20 5000 Tokens

### For Implementation of Polygon Id, You need four contracts,

<div>
<ul>
   <li> IcircuitValidator </li>
    <li> IZKPVerifier </li>
    <li> GenesisUtils.sol - 
    For converting number into hex values, bytes etc, you can replace this contract with any other contract or use    library in order to 
    convert this nuumbers into bytes and other operations. </li>
</ul>
</div>
